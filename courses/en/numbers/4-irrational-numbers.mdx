# Irrational numbers
- Irrational numbers are numbers that are not rational. That would mean that irrational numbers cannot be represented as a fraction or ratio of two integers. 
That is, irrational numbers cannot be shown in the form $\frac{a}{b}$.

- A famous example of an irrational number is $\pi$ (pi). is a number that is obtained when you take the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.

$$
\pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433...
$$

- The decimals go on forever without repeating. So there is no way to representas a ratio of two integers. 

- There are approximations of $\pi$ that can be represented as a ratio of two integers, the most common is 
$\frac{22}{7} = 3.142857143$ another is $\frac{355}{113} = 3.14159292$

- Indeed the 2nd approximation shows a value that is much more close to $\pi$.

- Other examples of irrational numbers includeewhich is another number like $\pi$.
$\sqrt{2}$ is also another example of an irrational number. In fact, the square roots of any positive integer ($ℤ_+$)
is always irrational except when the integer is a perfect square.
If you do not know what a perfect square is, do not worry you will come across it soon. Examples of perfect sqaures include 
$4, 9, 16$ and so on.
