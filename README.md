# MathOnTrack

MathOnTrack is a Next.js based, statically genernated web application aimed to help anyone and everyone to get back on a mathematical track!

## Aim

The main goal is to provide a basic to advanced knowledge in mathematics for free. This way, a user will be able to obtain enough knowledge to persue the career, job or education that was previously not accessible to them due to the lack of mathematical knowledge.

The courses will teach and explain, as well, provide exercises. However, one must rememeber that it is their effort that will ultimately help them rearch their goal.
