However, we do not observe what wave theory predicts. If red light is shone on the zinc plate no matter how bright and how long, photoelectrons are not released. 

There is a maximum wavelength for the light above which no photoelectrons are released, ever. Equivalently, there is a minimum frequency below which there are no photoelectrons released, known as the threshold frequency.

L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
