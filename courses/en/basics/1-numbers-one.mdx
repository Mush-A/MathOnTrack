# Photoelectrons

If UV light is shone onto a negatively charged zinc plate the plate loses its charge. 

The explanation for this is that light causes electrons to leave the metal, removing the negative charge. The electrons that are released are called photoelectrons.

Variations on this experience produce some surprising results: There is a certain minimum amount of energy that an electron needs in order to escape the surface of the metal. This energy is called the work function (É¸).

The wave theory of light allows some of the wave energy to be passed to electrons allowing them to gain work function and escape. In the wave theory, the energy carried by a wave depends on its amplitude, and amplitude for light means its brightness. 

Therefore, wave theory predicts that any electromagnetic wave or any color of light, if made bright enough cause the photoelectrons to be released.

Also, the light of lower amplitude could shine longer and slowly pass energy to the electrons until they gain the work function and escape.

However, we do not observe what wave theory predicts. If red light is shone on the zinc plate no matter how bright and how long, photoelectrons are not released. 

There is a maximum wavelength for the light above which no photoelectrons are released, ever. Equivalently, there is a minimum frequency below which there are no photoelectrons released, known as the threshold frequency.
