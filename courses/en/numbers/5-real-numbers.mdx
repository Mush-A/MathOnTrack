# Real numbers (ℝ or R)
- Real numbers simply consist of all rationals and irrationals. Note that all integers are rational numbers. So real numbers are all the numbers that we talked so far about.

- Any point on the number line is a real number. So you can simply think of real numbers as the set that encompasses all rationals and irrationals.

- Why do not we just call them ‘numbers’? Because there is another type of number called the imaginary number. We will get into that later.
