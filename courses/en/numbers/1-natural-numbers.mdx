# Natural numbers ($ℕ$ or $N$)
- Natural numbers are simply “counting” numbers. They are the numbers that a farmer may use to count the number of cows they have for example.

- Natural numbers are denoted by the symbol $ℕ$, or simply N when writing 
(a bold capital $N$)

- Natural numbers begin with 0 and continue by adding 1 to each successive term:
$$ℕ_0= \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…\}$$
In this case, Natural numbers are denoted as $ℕ_0$

- Some definitions of natural numbers start with 1 and continue by adding 1 to each successive term:
$$ℕ_1= \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5…\}$$
In this case, Natural numbers are denoted as $ℕ_1$
